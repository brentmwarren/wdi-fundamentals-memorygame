	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

We'd like to create a program that checks to see whether or not movie patrons are eligible for a discount and then displays the appropriate ticket price.

Here is the pricing structure:

1) If patrons are 65 or older, they are eligible for senior discounts. The ticket price for seniors is $6.00.

2) If patrons are 25 or younger, they are eligible for student discounts. The ticket price for students is $8.00.

3) All other tickets cost $10.00.

when a patron logs in to buy a movie ticket pop up a survey asking for age
the box will only accept inputs that are numbers between 0 and 120
close the survey if the submit button is cicked AND the survey has correct input
if not. prompt them to fill it out
if the number is less than 26, display a price of $8.00
if the number is great than 25 AND less than 65
display a number of $10.00
if the number is greater than 64 display a price of $6.00
